        <h2>Leaving Clean</h2>
        <p>Praise for <em>Leaving Clean</em> (forthcoming from <a href="http://brierycreekpress.wordpress.com/">Briery Creek Press</a>, May 2013):</p>
        <p class="blurb">
            “I understand bayous,” says Natalie Giarratano in <em>Leaving Clean</em>. This is not a poet
            place—<em>her</em> Orange, Texas—she simply knows it, knows what happens there, how the trees are
            bracing themselves for the hurricane, knows the mired look of a car on its back at the side of a
            muddy woods, the names of boats that brought slaves into Texas. She speaks of dark things in a
            voice that is quiet, but it is not shy; it is not even peaceful. Maybe it’s subtlety I’m talking about
            (<em>perceptive</em> being one of its synonyms), a humor that’s dire but unassuming, an anger that sort of
            travels under the radar. And what other poet would think to give a voice to a pair of tennis shoes
            that, hanging from a telephone wire, instruct us on the nature of time? Only Natalie Giarratano, with
            her wary grace and her vision that’s finally, somehow, redemptive.
            <br />

        <p class="blurb">
            Natalie Giarratano’s debut volume <em>Leaving Clean</em> brings to light a brilliant poetry that knows that the
            heart must break if it is to heal, again and again. In poems that evoke all the complex pungencies of
            the Texas Bayou, a weird, wholly recognizable America rises, ever ready to turn its head on the past
            it both creates and neglects. These poems contend with the ubiquity of violence in the individual
            consciousness, as they argue, implicitly or explicitly, with a vengeful God that embodies the
            cruelties we would not understand about ourselves. And there is grace here, and a kind of humility
            that refuses to be modest, and a longing that extends into the backwards of time, in details rendered
            magically and lovingly enough that individual and collective shame is out-ted and transformed by
            poetry into a common, intimate language.
            <br />

        <p class="blurb">
            In her stunning first book, <em>Leaving Clean</em>, Natalie Giarratano offers us an incisive look at a fallen
            world, cleansed neither of cruelty nor affection, of bitterness nor conflicted debt, what summons
            us to lines that, with a precision of wit and heartbreak, refuse the clean and easy answers. Again and
            again we find the spit of gods and fathers and the deep hunger of the traveler who longs to purge
            herself of such. There is no map to get us out of this place. Better yet, we have poems of fierce grace
            and difficult beauty, poems that plot escape but argue against it. In them we fall back to earth like
            love or some such gift of hard rain that dreams of nothing less.

        <p class="blurb">
            <em>Leaving Clean</em> is the debut of a new, original voice where the cartography of poet Natalie Giarratano’s
            inner visions turn themselves further inward, “the eye’s internal stare, /standing guard on the shore
            of her body /with lighthouse intensity,” interrogating the ruinous borders of memory where the
            poet dares her craft and gaze to take us. These poems refuse to look away and beg to be revisited
            over and over. You trust the power and vulnerability of this poet at once. In <em>Leaving Clean</em>, you
            will find a profound country unlike any other. Giarratano’s poems concern themselves with
            family, secrets, memory, “the spit of God,” the body, the physical world, and a broader, tempered
            omniscience about life itself. Against and within her voice, we are never lost or stranded by her
            awareness, “We’ve constructed a room / from ourselves where we hide / what secrets we have left.”
            You come through these poems as through a fire. It is exactly how Natalie Giarratano tells us: “It’s
            then I know there is no map I can buy / to show me the way out of here.”

                        The weather tells me how wooden I am, belly down to read the tide, trying to dry myself
                        out of this drifting; I am ten again in Galveston, not feeling guilty for ignoring the jellyfish
                        on the beach, never entering the water because of who might be floating in it, who might
                        brush her body—part flesh, part vegetation—against my skinny legs (never mind the science
                        of decomp; there’s always flesh); these days I know jellyfish are hardly breathing through
                        prisms of oil, are ovaries that men walk by with giant bags in which to collect them, to take
                        them home, wash them off, string them into necklaces; these days I’d rather be stone.

                <h3>New Coyote</h3>
                <pre>
It’s midnight in New Mexico, after who knows
how many nodding offs, CD changes,
and quiet tamale stands in Texas dust,
before we feel safe enough: hundreds of miles
from Johnson Space Center and the I-45
corridor, where Houston investigators              
routinely interview the bones of schoolgirls,
plenty far from looming rock formations
 
when out of the tumbleweed along I-10,
howls find their way out—coyotes siren
for hours. Voices that threaten if only because
they could be soundtracks of human laughter
pieced with screams. They appear along the sides
of the interstate only to disappear into dry dark.
The Chevy moves on quickly, its instinct
is to flee, it’s the coyote’s to chase us down,
 
it’s mine to turn the car around—save us all,
as if they need saving, these neophilic creatures;
but maybe it is in my nature to go back,
to be amazed at its smallness, how voice can be
so much bigger than body— like those of us
eight-year-olds who sang “We are the World” for seven
dead astronauts. They fell apart, their shuttle just dissolved:
a cube of ice in the fevered mouth of the universe.
 
And I used to be able to fall asleep
by tree song, that familiar lull of rustle
and fidget in wind. Instead: chickens rip
open wide the air with squawks as coyotes
raid the neighbor’s coop and schoolboys lead
their prize-winning pigs to slaughter like pied
pipers who must take everything apart.
How does this all work?
 
Coyotes showing up in subways and
elevators. That day. These newspaper
clippings. This looking back on it as though
jihad had forgone the spark of city for sky,
and all the days since I’ve tucked inside
skin and sleep, partly existing, never awake
to becoming some small wild dog that haunts
a desert it doesn’t need any more.

Notice both of us not because
you have to; sit in your car
at the red light because there’s
 
something you have to know:
all the birds are already here,
all of them weighing down
 
this wire, and we’re all fighting
lonesome—we cough up
sand to create our own
 
castles, our voices rise up
only to become stones
set loose to graze on hillsides.

There’s nothing but time here,
so, wait:  we could love you,
though, you should know,
 
we’ve seen the way you devote
yourself to pavement and always
appear to be rushing, leaving,
 
even if only molecules
and we know you are gone,
have seen you try to stomp
 
yourself out like a brown recluse
hiding in the cardboard
of that thing you call a chest.

The strings suspending us
disintegrate like the white
flowers on the church lawn

on which a dog daily pisses.
We’re not afraid, like his owner,
who carries a knife because                                                                                    
 
she dreams of a faceless stalker—
could be Jesus, an old lady or the po-
lice. This is such an easy town.
 
Everyone is semi-automatic, and kids
aren’t backed into corners by the white
face of the moon heavy above high-rises.

It’s in the seagull’s glassy
squawk—that dangerous way
one must find a music elastic
 
enough to carry all the songs
from all of the tides that have stopped
writing secrets of the universe
 
in sand; we just hum along
as though we already know
that music. It’s not enough—
 
living with this kind of make-
believe, flying even though
our heads are buried in sand.
