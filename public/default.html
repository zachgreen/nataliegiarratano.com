                        The weather tells me how wooden I am, belly down to read the tide, trying to dry myself
                        out of this drifting; I am ten again in Galveston, not feeling guilty for ignoring the jellyfish
                        on the beach, never entering the water because of who might be floating in it, who might
                        brush her body—part flesh, part vegetation—against my skinny legs (never mind the science
                        of decomp; there’s always flesh); these days I know jellyfish are hardly breathing through
                        prisms of oil, are ovaries that men walk by with giant bags in which to collect them, to take
                        them home, wash them off, string them into necklaces; these days I’d rather be stone.

                <h3>New Coyote</h3>
                <pre>
    It’s midnight in New Mexico, after who knows
    how many nodding offs, CD changes,
    and quiet tamale stands in Texas dust,
    before we feel safe enough: hundreds of miles
    from Johnson Space Center and the I-45
    corridor, where Houston investigators              
    routinely interview the bones of schoolgirls,
    plenty far from looming rock formations
 
    when out of the tumbleweed along I-10,
    howls find their way out—coyotes siren
    for hours. Voices that threaten if only because
    they could be soundtracks of human laughter
    pieced with screams. They appear along the sides
    of the interstate only to disappear into dry dark.
    The Chevy moves on quickly, its instinct
    is to flee, it’s the coyote’s to chase us down,
 
    it’s mine to turn the car around—save us all,
    as if they need saving, these neophilic creatures;
    but maybe it is in my nature to go back,
    to be amazed at its smallness, how voice can be
    so much bigger than body— like those of us
    eight-year-olds who sang “We are the World” for seven
    dead astronauts. They fell apart, their shuttle just dissolved:
    a cube of ice in the fevered mouth of the universe.
 
    And I used to be able to fall asleep
    by tree song, that familiar lull of rustle
    and fidget in wind. Instead: chickens rip
    open wide the air with squawks as coyotes
    raid the neighbor’s coop and schoolboys lead
    their prize-winning pigs to slaughter like pied
    pipers who must take everything apart.
    How does this all work?
 
    Coyotes showing up in subways and
    elevators. That day. These newspaper
    clippings. This looking back on it as though
    jihad had forgone the spark of city for sky,
    and all the days since I’ve tucked inside
    skin and sleep, partly existing, never awake
    to becoming some small wild dog that haunts
    a desert it doesn’t need any more.

    Notice both of us not because
    you have to; sit in your car
    at the red light because there’s
 
    something you have to know:
    all the birds are already here,
    all of them weighing down
 
    this wire, and we’re all fighting
    lonesome—we cough up
    sand to create our own
 
    castles, our voices rise up
    only to become stones
    set loose to graze on hillsides.

    2
 
    There’s nothing but time here,
    so, wait:  we could love you,
    though, you should know,
 
    we’ve seen the way you devote
    yourself to pavement and always
    appear to be rushing, leaving,
 
    even if only molecules
    and we know you are gone,
    have seen you try to stomp
 
    yourself out like a brown recluse
    hiding in the cardboard
    of that thing you call a chest.

 
    3
 
    The strings suspending us
    disintegrate like the white
    flowers on the church lawn

    on which a dog daily pisses.
    We’re not afraid, like his owner,
    who carries a knife because                                                                                    
 
    she dreams of a faceless stalker—
    could be Jesus, an old lady or the po-
    lice. This is such an easy town.
 
    Everyone is semi-automatic, and kids
    aren’t backed into corners by the white
    face of the moon heavy above high-rises.

    It’s in the seagull’s glassy
    squawk—that dangerous way
    one must find a music elastic
 
    enough to carry all the songs
    from all of the tides that have stopped
    writing secrets of the universe
 
    in sand; we just hum along
    as though we already know
    that music. It’s not enough—
 
    living with this kind of make-
    believe, flying even though
    our heads are buried in sand.
